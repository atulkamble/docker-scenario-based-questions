## üß© **Beginner-Level Scenarios**

|  #  | Scenario                     | Question                                                                                                                     |
| :-: | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Basic container start**    | You built a Docker image but forgot the command to run it. How do you check what command the image runs by default?          |
|  2  | **Container restart policy** | You deployed a container that crashes frequently. How can you ensure it automatically restarts unless stopped manually?      |
|  3  | **Inspect logs**             | A container exits immediately after start. How would you troubleshoot it using Docker commands?                              |
|  4  | **Networking**               | You run two containers that need to communicate. How can you ensure both are in the same network?                            |
|  5  | **Port conflicts**           | A container fails to start because port 8080 is already in use. How do you fix or identify which process is using that port? |
|  6  | **Tagging images**           | You built an image without specifying a tag. What tag will Docker assign automatically? How can you later tag it as `v1.0`?  |
|  7  | **Container cleanup**        | The system has too many stopped containers and unused images. How can you clean everything safely?                           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Intermediate-Level Scenarios**

|  #  | Scenario                                  | Question                                                                                                                                 |

|  4  | **Docker Compose dependency**             | You have two services ‚Äî web and db. How can you ensure the web service waits for db to be ready before starting?                         |
|  5  | **Container shell access**                | How do you connect to a running container‚Äôs shell for debugging?                                                                         |
|  6  | **Networking between host and container** | Your app in a container cannot reach an API running on your host machine. How do you allow communication between the host and container? |
|  7  | **Version mismatch**                      | Your CI pipeline builds fine locally but fails on Jenkins due to different Docker versions. How would you diagnose and fix it?           |

|  4  | **Multi-container debugging**  | In a Compose setup (web + redis + db), the app fails due to connection timeouts. How do you debug which container is causing the issue?                          |
|  5  | **Resource limits**            | Your container consumes excessive memory and crashes other services. How do you limit CPU and RAM usage per container?                                           |
|  6  | **Private registries**         | Your company uses a private Docker registry. How do you authenticate and pull images in CI/CD securely?                                                          |
